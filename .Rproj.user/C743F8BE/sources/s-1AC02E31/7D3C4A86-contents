**Submission instructions:**

  - This assignment is due to our grader, Zhiwei Zhen (zxz190002@utdallas.edu)
    by 11:59 pm, Wednesday, February 17. 
  - Please submit a `Rmd` file and a `pdf` file generated by R markdown.
  - Name your file `LastName4354hw2.pdf` and `LastName4354hw2.Rmd`, for example, `Chiou4354hw2.pdf` and `Chiou4354hw2.Rmd`.
  - The following submission policies will apply unless you have an emergency note:
      - Submission on Thursday, February 18, will be considered late and will be penalized (50\% penalty).
      - Submission after Thursday, February 18, will not be graded and be counted as a 0.
  - Please indicate by number which questions you are answering.
  - Please include a random seed if you use random number generators.
  - Start a problem in a new page, e.g., `\newpage`.

**Questions:** 

1. (2 pts) The following codes gives a vector of 1's and 2's:
    ```{R}
c(1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)
rep(1:2, 5)
    ```
    Give two more approaches that return the same vectors of 1's and 2's without using the `c()` and the `rep()` function.

2. (2 pts) The following `R` codes are used to generate numerical vectors `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, 
such that `median(x1)` = `mean(x1)`, `median(x2)` > `mean(x2)`, and `median(x3)` < `mean(x3)`.
    ```{R}
    x1 <- x2 <- x3 <- 1:10; x2[5] <- x2[6]; x3[5] <- x3[4]
    median(x1) == mean(x1)
    median(x2) > mean(x2)
    median(x3) < mean(x3)
    ```
Create a new set of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`, that satisfy these conditions. 

3. (2 pts) Given a sample, $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the sample variance is defined as
$$s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^n(x_i - \bar x)^2}{n - 1}.$$
Write a `R` function that takes a numerical vector as the input and calculates the sample variance after outliers are removed. Name this function `var2()`. To receive full credit, print `var2(1:10)` and `var2(exp(1:10))`.

\newpage

4. (2 pts) In `R`, the largest integer is $2^{31} - 1= 2147483647$. See for example: 

    ```{R}
    str(.Machine$integer.max)
    str(.Machine$integer.max + 1L)
```
What is the largest possible (numerical) value in `R`?

5. (2 pts) What is the probability to observe exact 7 heads when a fair coin is tossed 10 times? 
The answer to this question is 11.72\%. Use the following steps to verify this answer.

    Step 1: Use the `sample()` function to mimic a sequence of ten coin tosses. \newline
Step 2: Count the number of "heads" in Step 1. \newline
Step 3: Repeat Steps 1 and 2 1,000 times. 

    The average number of "heads" find in Step 3 provides a valid approximation to the probability to observe exact 7 heads when a fair coin is tossed 10 times. Report your average in Step 3.
